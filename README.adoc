Computer Survey
===============

Ask the computer the details about itself. Intended as a quick way to inventory
active computers.

Currently, using Powershell to process and WMI(DCOM) to interrogate the remote
system. Saving as a tab-seperated file.

Note: it is tab seperated because domain descriptions can contain commas as well
as some lists may return multiple values.
